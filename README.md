# HistoricalPlaces

I created such an app to experience a nice interface in Swift UI and to improve my skills in mapKit. It is coded with MVVM architecture.

There is no database, but new historical locations can be added from the project file.You can find the locations of the historical places registered in the application with a few images.You can get information about the place by clicking the Learn more button and you can find wikipedia links for more.
